:bookmark_tabs: My ideas for future projects: 
- mosquito ai
- GBA Gothic port
- AVL tree with GUI
- TES Arena Remaster (or a game that looks like Arena xd)
- A "game" in which some element (ex. char 'o') is looking for the element x in NxN array and it will look like in some kind of game - and it should follow this element
- tic-tac-toe multiplayer (host-clients).
- script (maybe py.) that will automatically delete one file from 'downloads' folder once in x days (files could be in stack, deleted file would be on top())
- spotify playlist merger with automatic updates (script in py. maybe)
- internet connection speedtest
- ski jumping wind compensation simulation

âŒ› In progress...:
- Crossword puzzle with random generated words (something like tasks in english books)

ðŸŒŸ Finished projects:
- Ipcalc
- Pytronome
