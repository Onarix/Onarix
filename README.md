### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

:bookmark_tabs: My ideas for future projects: 
- mosquito ai
- GBA Gothic port
- AVL tree with GUI
- TES Arena Remaster (or a game that looks like Arena xd)
- IpCalc (pending :hourglass_flowing_sand:)
- Crossword puzzle with random generated words (something like tasks in english books)
- A "game" in which some element (ex. char 'o') is looking for the element x in NxN array and it will look like in some kind of game - and it should follow this element
- tic-tac-toe multiplayer (host-clients).
